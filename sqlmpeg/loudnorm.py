"""Two-pass loudnorm: the measured values, their names, and the JSON parser.

``sqlmpeg.loudnorm2(stream, I => ..., TP => ..., LRA => ...)`` compiles to a
SEQUENCE of two ffmpeg commands. Pass 1 runs the same stream through
``loudnorm=<written opts>:print_format=json``, muxes nothing (``-f null -``)
and prints its measurements as a JSON block on stderr. Pass 2 runs the real
encode with those five numbers fed back in as ``measured_*``/``offset``, plus
``linear=true``.

Two consumers carry the numbers from pass 1 to pass 2, and they share the
parser below:

* the printed command line is a POSIX-shell chain --
  ``eval "$(<pass 1> 2>&1 | sqlmpeg loudnorm2env)" && <pass 2>`` -- where
  ``loudnorm2env`` turns the JSON into ``export SQLMPEG_LN_*=`` lines and
  pass 2's filtergraph splices those variables in through adjacent-quote
  concatenation (:func:`shell_word`);
* ``run`` uses no shell at all: it captures pass 1's stderr, parses it here,
  and substitutes the values straight into pass 2's argv
  (:func:`substitute`).

Two costs come with that shape, and the docs carry both: the printed command
needs ``sqlmpeg loudnorm2env`` on PATH at run time (it is the one compiled
output that is not pure ffmpeg), and it is POSIX-shell only -- cmd.exe and
PowerShell users run the query with ``run``.
