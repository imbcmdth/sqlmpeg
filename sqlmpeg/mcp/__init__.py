"""``sqlmpeg mcp``: the compiler as a stdio MCP server.

Two halves, split so the SDK is optional. :mod:`sqlmpeg.mcp.tools` is every
tool's body over the library API and imports nothing outside sqlmpeg;
:mod:`sqlmpeg.mcp.server` is the SDK wiring and is imported only when the
server actually starts. So the tools are unit-testable, and ``import
sqlmpeg.mcp`` works, on a machine that has no ``mcp`` package.

:func:`sdk_available` is what the CLI checks before starting: a missing SDK
is a message naming :data:`INSTALL_HINT`, never an ImportError traceback.
