"""The built-in types, declared as data.

Every shape the compiler knows is declared once here — the scalars, the four
stream records, the non-stream records, and the `container` an `input()`
alias is one row of. The column sets parser and lower work with
(:data:`ROW_SCHEMAS`, :data:`INPUT_COLUMNS`, :data:`UNNEST_COLUMNS`, ...) are
VIEWS over these declarations, computed at the bottom of this module. Nothing
else may restate them.

A :class:`Type` is a name, a kind, and an ordered tuple of :class:`Field`. A
field's ``type`` is another type's name, ``[]``-suffixed for an array.

Kinds:

    scalar     ``text``, ``number``, ``boolean`` — Postgres typing; boolean
               is what a `flag` entry holds and what a predicate answers,
               never a column of its own.
    handle     internal, with no name in the language: ``stream`` is the
               graph node behind a stream record — no field carries it,
               since the record IS the stream — and ``seek`` is
               ``<alias>.t``.
    stream     a record ABOUT a stream: ``video_stream``, ``audio_stream``,
               ``subtitle_stream``, ``data_stream``. The record IS the
               stream; identity is nominal, never field-by-field.
    record     a record that is not a stream and is a set of rows:
               ``chapter``, ``attachment``, ``cue``. An array of one unnests.
    map        a key/value record read by path off the column that holds it:
               ``tag``, ``flag``. ``f.tags.title`` names one entry; the array
               is never a set of rows, so it never unnests.
    container  the type of an `input()` row.

Field flags:

    writable   W: an assertion a query may make about the value, emitted as
               that stream's or container's metadata. Its opposite covers
               both a probed fact (RO — setting it is a rejection) and a
               handle, which is not a value a query can assert either way.
    exposed    the compiler surfaces this field TODAY. A field declared here
               but not yet wired up carries ``exposed=False`` and stays out
               of every view.

Field ORDER is column order: a row prints its fields in declaration order,
so every declaration below is written in the order that row already prints.
