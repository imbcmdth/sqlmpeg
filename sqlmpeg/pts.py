"""PTS-reset pass for sqlmpeg IR graphs.

``trim``/``atrim`` preserve the source's own timestamps: a stream trimmed
to start at 90s still carries frames whose PTS starts at 90s. Left alone,
that is a silent correctness bug -- two trims concatenated leave a gap the
length of the first one's offset, and one trim written to a file alone
carries a lead-in of however far into the source it began. Neither errors;
both play wrong.

This pass splices a ``setpts``/``asetpts`` node (``PTS-STARTPTS``, matching
the type of stream the trim carries) immediately in front of every consumer
of a ``trim``/``atrim`` node's output, UNLESS that consumer already IS a
``setpts``/``asetpts`` -- an author, or a macro expanding to one
(``sqlmpeg.speed``, see ``sqlmpeg/macros.py``), has already taken control of
that stream's timing, and a second reset would be redundant. The check is
per CONSUMER: one trim feeding both a bare output and an author's own
``setpts`` gets a reset spliced in front of the first and nothing in front
of the second.

This is exactly the shape ``lower.py``'s own WHERE-clause CTE trim already
uses (a ``trim``/``atrim`` node immediately followed by its own
``setpts``/``asetpts``, see ``_trim``) -- that path is already protected and
this pass is a no-op on it. It exists for the OTHER way a trim reaches the
graph: an explicit ``ffmpeg.trim(...)``/``ffmpeg.atrim(...)`` call, which
lowers like any other filter and gets no such treatment on its own.

Modeled on ``split.py``'s pass exactly: one memoized reset node per
trim/atrim ref, inserted immediately before its first unprotected consumer,
which keeps `nodes` topologically ordered the same way a split does. Runs
BEFORE `insert_splits` (`compiler.py`) so the split pass sees the final
topology -- a reset node with more than one consumer is fanned out like any
other.

Pure: returns a new Graph, never mutates `g`. A graph with no
``trim``/``atrim`` node is returned byte-identical (structurally: same
nodes, same refs, nothing added).
