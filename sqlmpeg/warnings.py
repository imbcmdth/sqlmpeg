"""Warnings: what a compile has to say without refusing to compile.

Every rejection sqlmpeg produces is a `SqlmpegError`, and that left nothing to
say about a compile that succeeded but cost something. Two package
resolutions cost something worth naming: a call that landed on a package
installed machine-wide rather than in the project the query lives in, and a
call into a LINKED directory, whose files are edited in place and so are not
pinned by any lockfile.

The channel is an optional ``on_warning`` callback threaded beside
``packages`` through the compile entry points, the same shape
:func:`sqlmpeg.execute.execute` already uses for ``echo``: the CLI passes a
sink it prints to stderr, the MCP tools pass one they return as a
``warnings`` array, tests pass a list's ``append``, and the default is None --
silence. No library code prints.

A compile warns at most once per package. A CLI command or an MCP tool
compiles the same text more than once (the table-query fallback), so
:class:`WarningLog` drops the repeats a second compile produces.
