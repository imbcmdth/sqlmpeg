"""Generate ``tests/data/reference_registry.json`` from the ffmpeg on PATH.

The reference snapshot is a committed TEST FIXTURE (plan 051): it lets the
test suite build a fully populated :class:`~sqlmpeg.registry.Registry` via
``sqlmpeg.registry.load_reference(path)`` with NO ffmpeg on PATH and NO
subprocess call, ever -- the same parsed ``-filters``/``-help`` shapes the
live disk cache uses, just captured ahead of time. It is NOT package data
and is not shipped in the wheel; nothing in the installed package reads it.

Unlike ``sqlmpeg.registry.load()``, which parses ``-help filter=X`` lazily
per filter on first reference, this script force-loads EVERY name's
options up front:

  - every in-fence filter's options (``Registry.options()`` over
    ``Registry.names()``)
  - every source's options (``Registry.options()`` over
    ``Registry.source_names()``)
  - the array-returning trio's options (``Registry.fenced_options()`` --
    ``channelsplit``/``acrossover``/``extractplanes`` are excluded from the
    filters/sources tables by the v1 pad fence, so ``options()`` cannot
    reach them; ``fenced_options()`` is the only door, see
    ``sqlmpeg/lower.py``'s ``ARRAY_RETURNING``)
  - the fixed-count N-input trio's options, for exactly the same reason:
    ``amix``/``hstack``/``vstack`` are ``N->1`` and equally fenced out, and
    their ``inputs`` option is what makes them callable at all (see
    ``sqlmpeg/lower.py``'s ``N_INPUT``)
  - the eleven "collision census" names (``Registry.fenced_options()`` too
    -- they are ordinary in-fence filters already covered by the
    ``options()`` pass above, so this adds no new data, but it exercises
    ``fenced_options()``'s cache-hit branch against a well-known name set;
    see docs/dynamic-filters.md "The collision census" and
    tests/test_lower.py's ``_KNOWN_COLLISIONS``)

Output is deterministic given the same ffmpeg binary and ``--stamp`` value:
every dict is written in INSERTION order (the only wall-clock-ish value is
whatever ``--stamp`` the caller passes, never ``datetime.now()``), and the
file is written LF-only (``tests/data/*.json`` is pinned in .gitattributes) so
regenerating on any platform reproduces byte-identical output.

Insertion order, NOT ``sort_keys=True`` (plan 051): an option table's ORDER is
load-bearing data, not presentation. It is ffmpeg's AVOption declaration
order, which is what positional filter arguments bind against
(``crop(f, 100, 50, 10, 20)``), so alphabetising it -- as this script did when
the snapshot was only ever read for its CONTENT -- silently rewrites every
positional call compiled against the snapshot. Insertion order is just as
deterministic here: it comes from parsing the same ffmpeg's ``-filters`` /
``-help`` output, in the order that output prints.

Usage::

    python scripts/gen_snapshot.py --stamp 2026-08-16

The generated file is COMMITTED (it is a checked-in fixture, not a build
artifact) -- rerun this after any ffmpeg upgrade this project pins against,
or after any change to ``sqlmpeg/registry.py``'s parsing rules that would
change the captured shapes. ``tests/test_gen_snapshot.py`` asserts (under
``@pytest.mark.exec``, since it requires the real binary) that regenerating
with the committed file's own ``generated`` stamp reproduces it exactly.
