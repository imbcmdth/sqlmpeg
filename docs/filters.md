# Filters

Every filter the installed ffmpeg reports is callable. The surface is introspected (`ffmpeg -filters`, then `ffmpeg -help filter=<name>` lazily), not hand-maintained.

One calling convention:

```
<name>(<stream inputs...>, <positional options...>, <named options...>)
```

- **Stream inputs first.** Count and types come from the pad signature (`unsharp` is `V->V`: one video in; `xfade` is `VV->V`: two). Mismatch: `UDF_ARG_TYPE`.
- **Positional options bind in declared order** - the order `ffmpeg -help filter=<name>` prints, identical to how `gblur=5:1` binds in a filtergraph. `gblur(a.frame, 5, 1)` is `sigma=5:steps=1`; `crop(a.frame, 640, 360, 0, 0)` is `out_w=640:out_h=360:x=0:y=0`.
- **Named options follow**, Postgres `name => value`: `unsharp(a.frame, luma_amount => 1.5)`, or mixed after positionals. A positional after a named argument is rejected; a named argument naming an option already bound positionally is `FILTER_OPTION_TYPE` ("already set"), never a silent override.

A positional validates as the option it lands on. Option errors are `UNKNOWN_FILTER_OPTION` (with did-you-mean) and `FILTER_OPTION_TYPE` (with type, range, or constants) - captured examples in [errors.md](errors.md).

## Values

Bare numbers, `true`/`false`, single-quoted strings. Enum options take the quoted constant name (`transition => 'wipeleft'`), not the integer. String-typed options accept ffmpeg expressions (`scale(a.frame, 'iw/2', -2)`, `overlay(a.frame, b.frame, '(W-w)/2', '(H-h)/2')`), evaluated per frame by ffmpeg. Expression content is not validated at compile time; a typo inside the quotes surfaces at run time.

## `enable`

`enable` is ffmpeg's timeline switch, a framework option rather than a filter option: an expression evaluated per frame; while false, frames pass through untouched.

```sql
SELECT gblur(a.frame, 12, enable => 'between(t,0.5,1.5)')
FROM input('clip.mp4') a
```

Accepted only on filters whose `ffmpeg -filters` line carries the `T` flag; elsewhere it is `UNKNOWN_FILTER_OPTION`.

## The `ffmpeg.` namespace

Some filter names are Postgres grammar (`overlay`, `trim`, `format`, ...) and parse as builtins before sqlmpeg sees them. `ffmpeg.<name>(...)` always means the raw filter and never collides:

```sql
SELECT ffmpeg.trim(a.frame, start => 1, end => 4),
       ffmpeg.overlay(a.frame, b.frame, x => 20, y => 20, eof_action => 'pass')
FROM input('a.mp4') a, input('b.mp4') b
```

Eleven bare names need it (measured against ffmpeg 7.1 / sqlglot 30.17): `copy`, `corr`, `format`, `median`, `normalize`, `null`, `overlay`, `pad`, `random`, `reverse`, `trim`. Whether a collision errors or mangles depends on arity; when in doubt, or in generated code, use the namespace.

`ffmpeg` is reserved: an alias, CTE, or view by that name is `UNSUPPORTED_SQL`.

## The `sqlmpeg.` namespace

Three macros that expand to subgraphs no single filter provides. Positional arguments only, in the documented order; named arguments are rejected. `sqlmpeg` is reserved like `ffmpeg`.

- **`sqlmpeg.delay(f, seconds)`** - delay a video stream on a transparent canvas (`format=pix_fmts=yuva420p` + `tpad=start_duration=<s>:stop=1:color=black@0`). Use for timed overlays: the delayed stream is invisible until its start time.

  ```sql
  SELECT overlay(f.frame, sqlmpeg.delay(p.frame, 120), 20, 20)
  FROM input('film.mkv') f, input('ad.mp4') p
  ```

  ```
  $ sqlmpeg compile -f query.sql
  ffmpeg -i film.mkv -i ad.mp4 -filter_complex '[1:v:0]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,tpad=start_duration=120:stop=1:color=black@0[n2];[0:v:0][n2]overlay=x=20:y=20[out0]' -map '[out0]' out.mp4
  ```

  For audio, use the bare filter in milliseconds: `adelay(a.audio[1], delays => '120000')`.

- **`sqlmpeg.speed(f, factor)`** - `setpts=PTS/<factor>`; 2 is double speed, 0.5 half.

- **`sqlmpeg.blur_regions(f, x, y, w, h, sigma)`** - crop the rectangle, `gblur` it, overlay it back in place.

## Generated sources in `FROM`

Zero-input filters (`testsrc`, `color`, `anullsrc`, `sine`, ...) live in `FROM` with a mandatory alias, namespace required:

```sql
SELECT f.video[1], f.audio[1] FROM input('clip.mp4') f
UNION ALL
SELECT t.video[1], s.audio[1]
FROM ffmpeg.testsrc2(duration => 1, size => '320x240', rate => 15) t,
     ffmpeg.anullsrc(duration => 1) s
```

Sources take options by name only (no input pads means no positional slots). A source alias exposes exactly one stream of one known type (`t.frame`/`t.video[1]` or `s.audio[1]`), carries no provenance, cannot be `WHERE`-trimmed (length comes from its own `duration =>`), and adds no `-i` to the command.

## Array-returning and N-input filters

Three filters return an **array** of streams, sized statically by an option: `ffmpeg.channelsplit` (per channel of `channel_layout`), `ffmpeg.acrossover` (per `split` frequency, plus one), `ffmpeg.extractplanes` (per plane). The result splats, subscripts, and broadcasts like any array:

```sql
WITH ch AS (
  SELECT ffmpeg.channelsplit(a.audio[1]) AS lr FROM input('stereo.mp4') a
)
SELECT amix(volume(ch.lr[1], 0.5), volume(ch.lr[2], 2.0))
FROM ch
```

```
$ sqlmpeg compile -f query.sql
ffmpeg -i stereo.mp4 -filter_complex '[0:a:0]channelsplit[n10][n11];[n10]volume=volume=0.5[n2];[n11]volume=volume=2.0[n3];[n2][n3]amix=inputs=2[out0]' -map '[out0]' out.mp4
```

Three N-input filters take however many streams you pass: `amix`, `hstack`, `vstack`. Their `inputs` option is set from the stream count; a written `inputs` that disagrees with the count is a typed error.

To choose which tracks to pass in the first place (by language, codec, resolution), use track rows: [tracks.md](tracks.md).

## Scope fence

Not callable:

- Variable-pad filters (`split`, `concat`) and multi-output filters (`scale2ref`, `feedback`), except the array-returning and N-input sets above. Calling one: `UNSUPPORTED_SQL`.
- Sources with more than one output pad (`avsynctest`, `movie`); all sinks.
- Options typed `binary` or `dictionary`: setting one is `FILTER_OPTION_TYPE`; the filter's other options work.
- Runtime filter commands (`sendcmd`, `zmq`).

## Introspection and binaries

`-filters` is parsed once per process; each `-help filter=<name>` once, on first reference. Results are cached on disk under `~/.cache/sqlmpeg/`, keyed by a hash of `ffmpeg -version`'s first line - upgrading ffmpeg invalidates the cache automatically. `sqlmpeg.registry.clear_cache()` wipes both layers.

ffmpeg and ffprobe are required. A system install on `PATH` wins; otherwise the bundled `static-ffmpeg` provisioner fetches both on first use. `sqlmpeg explain` shows what the registry resolved.
